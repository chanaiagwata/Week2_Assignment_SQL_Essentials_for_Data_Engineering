# Week 2 Assignment: SQL Essentials for Data Engineering

**This assignment focuses on the fundamentals of SQL for Data Engineering.**

## Topics Covered
1. Core SQL concepts (querying with conditions, joins).
2. Advanced SQL techniques (common table expressions, window functions, views, stored procedures, recursion).
3. Query optimization techniques.
4. Data modeling concepts (normalization, denormalization, star schema).

## Challenge
I found it challenging to:
- Interpret query execution plans after running queries with the `EXPLAIN` keyword.  
- Read and understand the values in the output table.  
- Figure out how to leverage the execution plan to optimize queries (beyond indexing non-indexed columns).
